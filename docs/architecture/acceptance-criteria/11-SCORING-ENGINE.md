# Acceptance Criteria: Component 11 — Scoring Engine

> Repository `repcheck-scoring-engine` containing three SBT projects: `score-cache` (publishable library for score reads/writes), `scoring-pipeline` (Cloud Run Job for user-member alignment scoring), and `stance-materializer` (Cloud Run Job for bill stance materialization and user-bill alignment).
> **Depends on**: `repcheck-shared-models` (Component 1), `repcheck-pipeline-models` (Component 2), `repcheck-prompt-engine-users` (Component 9), `repcheck-llm-analysis` / `llm-adapter` (Component 10), `repcheck-llm-analysis` / `in-process-ml` (Component 10 §10.5/§10.8 — SemanticEmbeddingService for reasoning embeddings).

## System Context

### What This Component Does

Component 11 is the **alignment scoring engine** — it computes how well each legislator's voting record aligns with each user's political preferences. **Scoring is always scoped to the representative relationship: a user is only ever scored against their own representatives (their house member and their state's senators).** It uses a combination of scheduled jobs and DB polling to determine when data is ready for processing.

Six processes coordinate the scoring lifecycle:

```
Process A: Pairing Validator (§11.6) — scheduled + user location change + member.updated
    ↓ persists user_legislator_pairings

Process B: Ingestion Pipelines (unchanged, Components 4/6/7/10)
    ↓ writes bills, votes, amendments, findings
    ↓ updates stance_materialization_status (has_votes / has_analysis)

Process C: Stance Materializer (§11.9) — scheduled DB scanner
    ↓ polls stance_materialization_status for bills with both votes + analysis
    ↓ writes member_bill_stances + member_bill_stance_topics (per-topic with reasoning/embedding)

Process D: User-Bill Alignment (§11.10) — scheduled
    ↓ processes changed bills + changed users
    ↓ writes user_bill_alignments, user_amendment_alignments

Process E: User-Member Scoring (§11.7, §11.8) — scheduled + ad-hoc
    ↓ Phase 1: numeric scores (parallel) → persisted immediately
    ↓ Phase 2: LLM explanations (parallel) → persisted after scores

Process F: Score Refresh Notifier (§11.11)
    ↓ publishes scoring.user.completed for ad-hoc requests
```

### Three SBT Projects

| Project | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `score-cache` | Library (publishable) | Repository for writing and reading pre-computed scores. Wraps all AlloyDB score table operations. No pipeline or Pub/Sub logic. |
| `scoring-pipeline` | Application (Cloud Run Job) | Orchestrates per-user scoring: reads pairings, aggregates stances, calculates alignment, generates LLM explanations, writes via score-cache. Scheduled + ad-hoc. |
| `stance-materializer` | Application (Cloud Run Job) | Scheduled job that materializes member bill stances (Process C) and pre-computes user-bill alignments (Process D). Polls DB for readiness. |

### The Scoring Flow

**Step 1 — User stance aggregation (§11.1)**

User stances are derived from Q&A responses using the pre-tagged question bank. The intelligence is in the question design, not the interpretation:

- **Multiple-choice answers** → algorithmic extraction (deterministic, no LLM):
  - Per-topic `stanceScore` = weighted average of contributions: `Σ(agreeDir × multiplier × weight) / Σ(weight)`
  - `agreeStance_direction = +1.0` if `agreeStance = "Progressive"`, `-1.0` if `agreeStance = "Conservative"`
  - Mathematically bounded to [-1.0, +1.0] — no clamping needed
  - Example: "Expand Medicare?" with `agreeStance = "Progressive"`, user selects "Agree" (`stanceMultiplier = 0.6`, `weight = 1.0`) → contribution of +0.6 toward healthcare stanceScore
- **Custom fill-in answers** → LLM interpretation via `preference-interpretation` profile (Component 9 §9.2), batched into a single call — stance adjustments only, no importance signal
- **No LLM for pure multiple-choice flows** — the common case requires zero LLM calls
- **Topic importance** — explicit user-provided weights from the "Prioritize your topics" screen completed after Q&A (stored in `user_topic_priorities`). Importance is NOT derived from answer frequency or `importanceSignal` values baked into questions.

Output: `UserTopicProfile` — list of `(topic, stanceScore, importance)` where `stanceScore` is -1.0 (strongly conservative) to +1.0 (strongly progressive), and `importance` is normalized 0.0-1.0 (sourced from explicit user topic prioritization).

**Step 2 — Legislator profile construction (§11.2)**

A query over pre-materialized `member_bill_stance_topics` — no LLM, no finding lookups:

For each topic the user cares about:
1. Fetch `member_bill_stance_topics` rows where the topic matches
2. Each row already contains: `stanceDirection`, `reasoning`, `reasoningEmbedding`, `findingId` (proof)
3. Contribution = `stanceDirection × voteWeight` (weight per vote type, per BEHAVIORAL_SPECS.md §2)
4. Average contributions across all votes for the topic → `stanceScore` per topic

The `member_bill_stances` table is a materialized cache — the stance materializer (§11.9) owns it and updates it when the DB scanner finds bills with both votes and completed analysis.

**Step 3 — Alignment score calculation + LLM explanation (§11.3, §11.4)**

- **Algorithmic base scoring (§11.3)**: Per-topic alignment = `1.0 - abs(userStance - legislatorStance) / 2.0`. Weighted average across topics using user importance. This is the **authoritative score** stored in `scores.aggregate_score`.
- **LLM explanation (§11.4)**: Sonnet/Haiku call via Component 9 prompt engine → `AlignmentScoreOutput`. The LLM's `overallScore` is NOT stored as the alignment score — it is for explanation context only. Reasoning is stored in both `scores.reasoning` and `score_history.reasoning`. Evidence is sourced from pre-materialized `member_bill_stance_topics` and `user_bill_alignments`.

### Score Storage (Two Tiers)

**Current scores** (overwritten on each re-score, optimized for fast frontend reads):

| Table | Key | Content |
|-------|-----|---------|
| `scores` | (user_id, member_id) | `aggregate_score`, `status`, `last_updated`, `llm_model`, `total_bills`, `total_votes`, `non_overlapping_topics`, `reasoning`, `reasoning_embedding` |
| `score_topics` | (user_id, member_id, topic) | `score` per topic |
| `score_congress` | (user_id, member_id, congress) | `overall_score`, `bills_considered`, `votes_analyzed` per congress |
| `score_congress_topics` | (user_id, member_id, congress, topic) | `score` per congress per topic |

**Score history** (append-only, for trend charts):

| Table | Key | Content |
|-------|-----|---------|
| `score_history` | score_id (UUID) | `aggregate_score`, `status`, `trigger_event` ("scheduled" / "ad-hoc"), `reasoning`, `reasoning_embedding` |
| `score_history_congress` | (score_id, congress) | `overall_score`, `bills_considered`, `votes_analyzed` |
| `score_history_congress_topics` | (score_id, congress, topic) | `score` |
| `score_history_highlights` | (score_id, bill_id, topic) | `stance`, `vote`, `alignment` |

### Persistence Mapping

| Table | Written By | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `user_legislator_pairings` | `PairingValidator` (§11.6) | At signup, scheduled validation, user location change |
| `stance_materialization_status` | Votes pipeline, Analysis pipeline | On vote position change, analysis completion |
| `member_bill_stances` + `member_bill_stance_topics` | `StanceMaterializer` (§11.9) | Scheduled scanner finds bills with both votes + analysis |
| `user_bill_alignments` + `user_amendment_alignments` | `UserBillAligner` (§11.10) | Scheduled, for changed bills and changed users |
| `scores` + `score_topics` + `score_congress` + `score_congress_topics` | `ScorePersister.upsertScore` (§11.5) | After each scoring run |
| `score_history` + sub-tables | `ScorePersister.appendHistory` (§11.5) | After each scoring run (append) |

### Event Contracts

| Event | Direction | Payload | Reference |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `member.updated` | **Consumes** (Pairing Validator) | `{ memberId }` | Component 2 §2.1 |
| `user.profile.updated` | **Consumes** (Pairing Validator + User-Bill Alignment) | `{ userId, topicsChanged[] }` | Component 2 §2.1 |
| `scoring.user.requested` | **Consumes** (Scoring Pipeline) | `{ userId, requestId, source }` | Component 2 §2.1 |
| `scoring.user.completed` | **Emits** (Score Refresh Notifier) | `{ userId, requestId, memberScoreCount, status }` | Component 2 §2.1 |

> The scoring engine does NOT consume `analysis.completed` or `vote.recorded` events. Those events update `stance_materialization_status` in the DB (by their respective pipelines). The stance materializer (§11.9) polls the DB for readiness.
